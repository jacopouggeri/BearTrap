## This is a Vintage Story mod
Add Bear traps to the game. Simple. To craft them, obtain two bear trap jaws by smithing, then craft the trap using nails and strips to join them together. Be careful about handling the open trap when not sneaking!

This mod adds a seeking food behaviour to bears, so placing appropriate bait in the traps (Protein or Fruit) will attract them. Other animals will also be attracted to proper bait,
just like with a basket trap, but bear in mind that it will easily kill smaller animals.
